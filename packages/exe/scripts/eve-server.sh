# Restart a self-hosted eve agent and PROVE it took.
#
# Ships with @kybernesis/exe. Copy is installed into scripts/ by `kyb init`
# for an exe host; run it as `bash scripts/eve-server.sh`.
#
# Why this exists: a restart that silently fails is worse than no restart. If an
# old process survives (or a new one dies at boot), the agent keeps serving a
# stale build — new connections, instructions, and tools simply never appear,
# and every subsequent test measures yesterday's agent. This kills every eve
# process, waits for the port to actually free, starts via the CLI (which is
# what performs sandbox prewarm), and then asserts the new process started
# AFTER the build it is supposed to be serving.
#
# Two things this script learned the hard way:
#
#   1. Restarts arrive concurrently. @kybernesis/manage fires one 20s after any
#      change, and a human runs one by hand. Two overlapping runs both pass
#      their kill phase before either starts, and the result is TWO supervisors
#      and TWO servers sharing one durable store — two executors racing over the
#      same runs. That is not a slow agent, it is a corrupt one. The flock makes
#      restarts strictly serial.
#
#   2. Restarting into a live turn destroys it. The in-flight step dies with the
#      process and does not come back: the turn never emits another event, the
#      session never parks, and every later message is held behind a turn that
#      will never finish. The user sees a spinner forever. So wait for the
#      agent to be idle before killing it.

# Studio reports success and changes nothing.
# node_modules counts as source: eve BUNDLES dependencies into .output at
# build time, so patching an installed package changes nothing until a
# rebuild. Learned by patching a package on this host, restarting, and
# watching the old code keep serving while every timestamp said the restart
# was fine — the build was current with respect to everything it checked.
